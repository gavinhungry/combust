combust
=======
combust is an iptables-based firewall script with profiles.


Usage
-----
All configuration options are located in `combust.conf`.

A systemd service unit (`combust.service`) and OpenWrt-style init script
(`combust.rc`) is provided.


Notes
-----
Clearly, combust is limited in the tasks it can perform (being limited to what I
currently need it do to).
