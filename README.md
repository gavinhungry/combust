combust
=======
Combust is a simple iptables firewall script to unify the mulitple, rapidly
diverging firewall scripts I've been maintaining.


Configuration
-------------
All configuration options are in `combust.conf`, however clearly it won't do
everything you could ever possibly want (just everything that I currently need
it to do).
